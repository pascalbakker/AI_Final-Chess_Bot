''' This chess bot should be able to (wait for it...) play chess efficiently
and at a rating of at least 1200.

It should carry out strategy in the form of
a good opening, an adaptive and responsive middle game, and a decisive end game.

It will use a database of chess games in order to search for the 'best' move
for each new scenario.'''
